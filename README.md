# Web_scrape
Web Scraping the apartment values in Palghar district using bs4
The website which I scraped used to load the data as we scroll down so I first load all the data saved that html file in my local desktop.
Then used that html file to get all the values becaues bs4 does not allow to retrieve all the data from the website that loads data on scrolling

# Data Analysis
Cleaned the scarped values
Tried to analyse it with pandas
